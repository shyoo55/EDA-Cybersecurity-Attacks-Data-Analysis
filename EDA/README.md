# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Of Cybersecurity Attacks  Dataset
by(Shaikha Bin Ateeq )


# Introduction :
Organizations are becoming more vulnerable to cyber threats because of the growing global reliance on computers, networks, programs, social media, and data Data breaches, a typical cyber attack, have a huge negative impact on businesses and are frequently caused by inadequately safeguarded data.For information security, it's no longer enough to rely on traditional IT personnel and security protocols. Threat intelligence tools and security programs are clearly needed to lower your organization's cyber risk and identify potential attack surfaces. I intend to work with data on cybersecurity attacks that I obtained from Kaggle, which recorded the events of various cybersecurity attacks of varying durations and patterns.[
In this project, I will be using Exploratory Data Analysis approach as known as EDA, which aims to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics mostly by employing data visualization methods.  However I am planning to understand the the patterns of  Cybersecurity attacks and the  Most Logical Ports attacked and the common type of attacks in additions the Different time of the day , (hours,night,morning ) and so on The goal of these analyzes is to know the origin and type of attacks and to try to raise the level of protection in those vulnerabilities



# Data Overview :

The data will help us understand the nature of Cybersecurity attacks and raising the level of protection in the port where cyber-attacks often occur
The features provided in the dataset are:

Attack category : Type of registered cybersecurity attack

Attack subcategory: A subcategory of the type of cybersecurity attack registered

Attack Name: The technical name for the cybersecurity attack

Time: Start and end date of the attack in timestamp format

Protocol: The protocol used for the attack.

Source IP:  IPv4 address where the attack came from.

Source Port: The logical port where the attack came from.

Destination IP: Destination IPv4 address.

Destination Port: Logical destination port




# Tools:
Tools:
To explore and analyze the data, I will be using Jupyter notebook to use python language and Python libraries, such as: 

Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. 

Numpy and Panda for data read and write operations
